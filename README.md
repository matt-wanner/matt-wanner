- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @matt-wanner
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data science for applications of supervised and unsupervised machine learning towards the solving of real world problems.
- I have worked as a data scientist for 4 years on various projects including various statistical and deep supervised NLP models, deep learning for image recognition, and unsupervised user activity profiling.
- I have built a number of tools along the way to support these projects including various preprocessing and web scraping algorithms.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about various methods of dimensionality reduction and the tools used to measure and describe the quality of a reduction as well as how to use BiPlots to interpret them.
